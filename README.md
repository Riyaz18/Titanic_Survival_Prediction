# Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📝 Overview
This project focuses on **data preprocessing** and **handling missing values** in the Titanic dataset.  
It's designed especially for **beginners** who are learning how to clean data before building machine learning models.

---

## 🔧 What I Did
- ✅ Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas  
- 🔍 Explored the dataset and checked for missing values  
- 🧹 Filled missing values:
  - Used **median** for numerical columns like `Age`
  - Used **mode** for categorical columns like `Embarked`
- 🧠 Created a new feature `Family_Size` by combining `SibSp` and `Parch`
- 🧽 Cleaned unnecessary columns (like `Cabin` which had too many missing values)
- 📊 Prepared the data for modeling

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters
Cleaning data is a **critical first step** in any data science or machine learning project.  
By understanding how to handle missing values, you set a strong foundation for building accurate models.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Seaborn and Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 Next Steps
You can use this cleaned dataset to:
- Build a logistic regression model
- Try out other classification algorithms
- Explore feature engineering
